## Description
***
We have created a module to extract and analyze customer-supplied data, especially a project to show and save information in graphs and csv files to make modulation performance of the modulator easier to see.


## Prerequisite
***
* Install pandas to process data. It is known as an essential library for tasks such as data analysis using Python.<http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/>
* Install xml.etree.elemenTree. The module implements a simple and efficient API for parsing and creating XML data.
* Install numpy. Numpy is Python package that deals with numerical data. It is mainly used in linear algebra calculations using vectors and matrices via ndarray, a multidimensional matrix data structure called the core of Numpy.
* Install matplotlib.pyplot. Used to vissualize data understanding prior to data analysis, or to visualize results after data analysis.
* Install lmfit. Lmfit provides a high-level interface to non-linear optimization and curve fitting problems for Python.

* If you want inastall all prerequistite, Write `pip install -r requirements.txt.`

## Usage
***
1. We carried out this project using Pycharm. In order to run this program, the user must install the pycham.
2. Run in Pycharm Run.py and open or select the data file you want to analyze.
3. Write wafer or coordinates you want to analyze afterwards.
4. Choose whether to show data, save figure, or save csv files.

* If you do not run with Pycharm, you may experience an error that fails to stop while the program is in progress.

## Files
***
* src
  * directory.py - If there is no directory, it is a code that functions to create a new directory.
  * extract.py - It is a code that extracts information from a given xml data and has the ability to store it by replacing it with a file in csv format.
  * graph.py - Using the polyfit function, we obtain the polynomial closest to a given data and represent it in graphs.
  * path.py 
  * process.py - Based on the options received from run.py, the code is executed by selecting specific properties (image, wafer, image) from the data.
* gitignore   - Files that do not need to be managed in the project were managed using the gitignore file to exclude them from git.
* run.py      - It is the code that executes the project, and it receives several options to execute the Src file.
